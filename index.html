                        <h3>Detection of Distributed Denial of Service Attacks in Software Defined Networks</h3>
                        <h4> 2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)</h4>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture is a
                            new and novel way of network management. In SDN, switches
                            do not process the incoming packets. They match for the incoming
                            packets in the forwarding tables and if there is none it will
                            be sent to the controller for processing which is the operating
                            system of the SDN. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
                            attack is a biggest threat to cyber security in SDN network
                            .The attack will occur at the network layer or the application
                            layer of the compromised systems that are connected to the
                            network.In this paper we discuss the DDoS attacks from the
                            traces of the traffic flow. We use different machine learning
                            algorithms such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest neighbour, K-means
                            and K-medoids to classify the traffic as normal and abnormal.
                            Then these algorithms are measured using parameters such as
                            detection rate and efficiency.The algorithm having more accuracy
                            is chosen to implement Signature IDS and results of it are then
                            processed by Advanced IDS which detects anomalous behaviour
                            based on open connections and provides accurate results of the
                            hosts specifying which hosts is involved in the DDOS attack.

                        <h4>Part of the Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering book series (LNEE, volume 545)</h4>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Over the years, data generated by the social media is extremely large in volume. This large volume of data is known as big data. Several physical resources are required to store big data; in order to avoid, these cloud resources can be used. Cloud resources are provided by Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, Rackspace, and many more. Stored big data can be used for analysis of traffic management, call center optimization, real-time fraud detection, social media, and sentimental analysis. Solutions for analyzing big data on cloud are presently not available. Users must obtain the essential cloud computing resources and install the necessary software manually. This can be a cumbersome task for complex distributed services. To address this issue, the services should be viewed as a single application consisting of virtual machines. Users should no longer be concerned about individual machines or their internal organization. To overcome this problem, an OpenStack cloud system with multi-node setup to provide Hadoop as a service to the users has been implemented. Users can easily access the Hadoop service which is provided by OpenStack cloud environment.

Flexibility, scalability, reliability, and security play a vital role in the future Internet, thus has to be achieved efficiently, so this inflexibility causes a challenge. Over the past few years, the well-liked topic in the era of networking is Software-defined networking (SDN). This gives rebirth to the programmable networks which/that open a door for new network paradigm. OpenFlow protocol is a basic building block of SDN networks. SDN operates on OpenFlow protocol through which the idea of programmable networks is accomplished. SDN converts the traditional network architecture by separating network logics into two different planes: control plane and data plane. SDN is extended for various applications; this causes imbalanced network utilization. The paper begins by introducing the SDN to this background OpenFlow architecture and SDN architecture is discussed and to examine the existing challenges in SDN. Finally, an emulation of SDN environment is presented using Mininet, which implements load balancing for the SDN with traffic segregation based on input traffic. The results show that solution provided helps to balance the performance of network in terms of Throughput, Delay, and Packet loss that fosters maximized QoS.

                            Server virtualization is a technological innovation broadly used in IT enterprises. Virtualization provides a platform to run
                            different services of operating systems on the cloud. It facilitates to build multiple virtual machines on a single basic physical
                            machine either in the form of hypervisors or containers. To host many microservice applications, the emergent technology has
                            introduced a model which consists of different operations performed by smaller individual deployed services. Thus, the demand
                            for low-overhead virtualization technique is rapidly developing. There are many lightweight virtualization technologies; docker is
                            one among them, which is an open-source platform. This technology allows developers and system admins to build, create, and
                            run applications using docker engine. This paper provides the performance evaluation of Docker containers and virtual machines
                            using standard benchmark tools such as Sysbench, Phoronix, and Apache benchmark, which include CPU performance, Memory
                            throughput, Storage read/write performance, load test, and operation speed measurement.

                        The upsurge in the Internet of Things (IoT) has led towards an increasing interest in simplifying the control mechanism
                        in the wireless network. The control mechanism is a challenge as it involves data acquisition and analysis, decision making, and
                        actuation/control in IoT networks. This has led towards combining Software Defined Networks (SDN) and IoT for easy of
                        controlling the network devices. The mobile application available at the tip of hands to control the connected devices to the
                        internet has led to exponential growth in data. The management and handling the data intensive applications is a challenge to the
                        network operators.
                        SDN is a paradigm shift that enables network programmability, control, and management of diverse networking
                        devices. This paper describes the data transmission in SDN and integration of SDN and IoT. The light weight protocol Message
                        Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is used for data transmission between the IoT devices. The result analysis shows that the
                        light weight protocol MQTT is 30% efficient for data transmission in SDN IoT architecture. The testbed for integrating virtual
                        network in SDN and real-time network for IoT applications using lightweight protocol is described.

                            Cloud computing is a distributed platform that offers dynamic provisioning of on-demand resources to the users. The rapid growth of cloud computing is due to its adaptive nature that brings enormous benefits to the organizations. OpenStack is a cloud operating system used to build public and private clouds. OpenStack consists of a number of interconnected entities that are combined to govern the processing of compute, network and storage resources. Resource scheduling in OpenStack deals with provisioning of compute resources. Nova-scheduler is a component of OpenStack Compute service which is responsible for resource scheduling. The default nova-scheduler used in OpenStack is Filter Scheduler. The scheduling approach presently used is ineffective in terms of cost, resource usage and energy cost per server. To address these issues, we propose a SLA (Service Level Agreement)-aware resource scheduling strategy which provides better gain to both customers and cloud service providers. We carry out the experiments using real-time multinode private cloud setup. The results reveals the effectiveness of the designed resource scheduling model.

                        <h4>2020 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)</h4>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The growth of the network, increase in users, as well as surfacing of new technologies, such as cloud computing and big data has posed difficulties in managing traditional networks. To address this problem, Software Defined Network has been proposed which tends to govern the network in a better way. Traffic management technologies include traffic load balancing, QOS based scheduling. To fit in the prerequisites of quality of service, load balancing has to be considered as a crucial concept because it assists in controlling and regulating data traffic among numerous resources amplifying the network responsiveness, steadfastness and capacity. Network today needs to manage heavy traffic and serve clients in huge numbers at once. Using multiple servers with a load balancer is one of the solutions to this problem such that the clients can direct the request to load balancer which can further forward these requests to distinct servers after being subjected to load balancing strategy. Load balancing in a conventional network is based on the native information of the network and is nonprogrammable. But, SDN controllers have a global vision of the network and are also programmable which helps them design optimized load balancing mechanisms. In this paper, we have implemented Round Robin load balancing strategy and Random load balancing strategy using an OpenFlow switch. Mininet simulation results using round robin algorithm have led to higher throughput and decreased packet loss when compared to default random scheduling algorithm.

                        <h4>2020 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN)</h4>

                            Software Defined Networking is a developing pattern in a computer network that authorize a controller to control and keep track of the entire network state of a system. Traditional networks are not compatible for business ventures since they are manually configured (static) and are inflexible. To solve the problems related to traditional network framework, SDN is considered as an effective solution because SDN is dynamic and easily manageable. Quality-of-Service (QoS) is a list of network requirements that is mentioned in Service Level Agreement (SLA) and this requirements has to be satisfied when a packet is being streamed from one node to another node in a network. QoS metrics provide a sophisticated way to prioritise the network traffic over a network to guarantee better performance. QoS assures that the priorities of routing does not change because change-in prioritise may lead to jitter, packet loss and delay. With rapid development in the cloud computing environment for hosting various virtual applications, Quality Of Service (QoS) has to be maintained while delivering the services that were specified in the Software Level Agreement (SLA). Network Traffic Management helps the administrator to reduce the congestion, packet loss, latency, and also ensures smooth network operations with the help of traffic monitoring tools and techniques. The proposed work presents the QoS aware routing using the OpenDayLight controller. To implement the routing algorithm the bandwidth and the delay parameters are considered. These help to manage the resources of the network by prioritizing specific types of packets on the network. Packet switching not only forwards the data packets but also focuses on selecting the optimal path available for routing of these packets based on certain parameters.

                            Cloud forensics investigates the crime committed over cloud infrastructures like SLA-violations and storage privacy. Cloud storage forensics is the process of recording the history of the creation and operations performed on a cloud data object and investing it. Secure data provenance in the Cloud is crucial for data accountability, forensics, and privacy. Towards this, we present a Cloud-based data provenance framework using Blockchain, which traces data record operations and generates provenance data. Initially, we design a dropbox like application using AWS S3 storage. The application creates a cloud storage application for the students and faculty of the university, thereby making the storage and sharing of work and resources efficient. Later, we design a data provenance mechanism for confidential files of users using Ethereum blockchain. We also evaluate the proposed system using performance parameters like query and transaction latency by varying the load and number of nodes of the blockchain network.
