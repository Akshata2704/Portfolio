                        <h4> IRJET Journal 2020</h4>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The global positioning system is playing a major
                            role in our day-to-day lives. All smartphones today have GPS,
                            which has made our lives simple. We can easily track a vehicle
                            or find the route to an unknown place at our fingertips. We
                            can also share our live locations. Besides all these applications,
                            GPS fails when it comes to indoor. GPS is a network of satellites
                            and it finds the location by calculating its distance from three
                            or more satellites, based on the signals received. When we try
                            to use GPS indoor, the signals will be scattered by the walls
                            and roof of the building and get attenuated. The distance
                            calculated from the attenuated signals won’t be accurate
                            which makes GPS not suitable to use indoor.
